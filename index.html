#Laser Tag

### 6.08 Spring 2018 | August Trollback, Nickolas Stathas, Ramya Durvasula, Renee Silva

# Introduction

In a traditional game of laser tag, players, armed with infrared guns, fire at each other to
score points or disable their opponents. In an attempt to recreate the fun of this exciting
pasttime, without the price tag, our group designed <i>Laser Tag!!!</i>. Complete with custom
hardware and wearable armor, <i>Laser Tag!!!</i> was a great way to integrate and extend the
knowledge we gained from 6.08.

# System Overview

Our system consists of several modules: ESP32s, wearable "armor," a gameplay server, and a website.
The ESP32 code, written in Arduino, interfaces with several infrared receivers (the targets), a speaker,
and a handheld infrared emitter (the gun). Each ESP32 and its associated components are attached
to a wearable device, and are connected via wires. The ESP32s use HTML GET and POST requests to communicate
with the game server, which keeps track of the current game, its players, and all game actions. Additionally,
the game server keeps track of high scores. The website is used to start games, view scores during games, and
forceably end games if need be.

# Hardware

Three different custom printed circuit boards (PCBs) were designed, and several of each type
was subsequently ordered from a Chinese fabricator. The three types of boards are a receiver
module, an emitter module, and a master board that connects to several receiver modules and
one emitter module.

### Receiver module

The receiver modules have IR receivers that are activated when IR at a specific frequency (~56kHz)
hits them. Each player wears four receiver modules on their body - two on the arms, one soldered
directly to master board on the chest, and one on the back. Using this layout, it is possible for
a player to get hit from many angles.

### Emitter module

The emitter module is contained within the grip of the laser gun. The module produces IR pulses
tuned to the specific frequency the receivers accept. The module has an input and ouput trigger
data line to the ESP32 on the master board. The output trigger line directly connects the physical
trigger button on the laser gun to the ESP32. The input trigger line is used to start and stop emitting
IR pulses. Having the physical trigger signal and IR pulse signal be separate allows us to implement
features such as cooldown and ammo limiting.

### Master board

The master board serves as a centralized place to mount boards (ESP32, power board, DFPlayer)
and distribute power/signals.

### Connectors/Cables

Cables were cut to length, stripped, crimped, and heat shrunk

### Laser Gun

The laser gun was modeled in Autodesk inventor and designed so that it could be fitted with the IR
emitter LED inside the barrel and the driving circuitry in the handle.
